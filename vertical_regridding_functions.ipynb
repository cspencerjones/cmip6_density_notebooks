    "### Vertical Regridding \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The math**\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of vertical regridding is to take a model that has depth (z) as its vertical grid, and translate it to some tracer (c (x,y,z,t)): $f(x,y,z,t) \\rightarrow \\tilde{f}(x,y,\\tilde{c},t)$. This operation can be written cleanly using dirac-delta functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tilde{f}(x,y, \\tilde{c},t) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\int f(x,y, z,t) \\delta [c(x,y,z,t) - \\tilde{c}] dz\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the thickness defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma  = \\int \\delta (c(x,z,t) - \\tilde{c}) dz\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "and the integrals are evaluated over the entire depth. When an integrand is multiplied by the dirac-delta function, the integration only picks up the values of the integrand at places where the dirac-delta function's argument is zero (or the location where tracer value (c) is the same as the tracer value that is being projected on ($\\tilde{c}$)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The division by the thickness can be understood by an **example** and thinking discretely. Imagine that in a column of water that is 1000m deep there is a tracer that has value 1 between 600 and 700m, and zero everywhere else. Let's say the function that needs to be regridded is the velocity. For $\\tilde{c} =1$, the integral will give us a vertical sum of the velocity b/w 600 and 700m ($\\int_{600}^{700} u dz$), which will have units of $[L^2]/T$. To find the average velocity on the region where the tracer has value 1, we need to divide by the thickness (units $[L]$) of this vertical region ($\\sigma(\\tilde{c}) = \\int_{600}^{700} dz = 100m$). (An an exercise you can think of what happens for $\\tilde{c} =0$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerical Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, in practice it is almost impossible to work with dirac-delta functions, we instead rely on bins. So $\\hat{f} (x,y, \\hat{c},t)$ is an approximation to $\\tilde{f}(x,y, \\tilde{c},t)$, and $\\hat{c}$ is an approximation to $\\tilde{c}$ that allows values in some binned range $\\hat{c} = \\tilde{c} \\pm \\triangle \\tilde{c}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this binning is by making histograms. A histogram function finds all points with values that lie in a certain range of bin, which is like gathering the locations on the grid that will be used in the integral (a discrete approximation to the dirac-delta function). These values can then be weighted by $dz$ and the corresponding function values $f$ at the points found by histogram to estimate the integral. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the logic in Julius's function, reproduced below:"
